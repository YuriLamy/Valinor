VarLD README
==============
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 25 Jan 2010


Pre-requisites and Necessary Files
==================================
Java version 1.5 and above is needed.
Can check by typing on command prompt > java -version

Below is a list of the necessary files that are needed for VarLD to work.
These files should be placed in the same directory.
1. commons-primitives-1.0.jar (Apache Commons Primitives)
2. commons-cli-1.2.jar (Apache Commons Command Line arguments parser)
3. rgenetics-1.0.jar (VarLD implementation)
4. JAMA (a Java Matrix package which is already included in rgenetics-1.0.jar)


Synopsis
========
  java -jar rgenetics-1.0.jar -p VarLD [options] input_file1 input_file2


Description
===========
VarLD program reads two genotype input files belonging to two different populations/groups, 
and calculates the VarLD statistic between them.

Format of input genotype file: a tab-delimited text file with columns
1. rs_id/snp_id
2. position
3. genotype_1
4. genotype_2
5. etc.. 

Positions are to be in ascending order, and are assumed to belong to the same chromosome/gene.
The position information is taken from the first input file.
For targeted varLD, if start/end position is not specified, it will assume the first/last snp
in the first input file.

Genotypes are coded as numerals 1,2,3,4 with 
1 as homozygote AA, 
2 as heterozygote Aa, 
3 as homozygote aa, and 
4 as missing.
Each row represents one SNP, while the columns represent the individuals/samples.

Format of genomewide VarLD output: a tab-delimited text file with columns
1. population identifier 1
2. population identifier 2
3. mean basepair position of sliding window of snps considered
4. raw varLD statistic

An example input dataset, and additional scripts for standardizing genomewide varLD for plotting and interpretation
can be found at http://www.nus-cme.org.sg/software/varld.html
